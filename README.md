# Thread View Count Feature

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple Thread View Count feature.
The feature shows how many users have viewed a thread or post.

## How It Works
1. When a user opens a thread, the system records a view.
2. The view count increases by one.
3. The updated view count is displayed below the thread.

## Why This Feature Is Important
- Helps identify popular threads
- Allows creators to measure engagement
- Improves user interaction on the platform

## Example Platforms
- Threads (Meta)
- X (Twitter)
- Instagram

## Simple Flow
User opens thread → View count +1 → Display updated count
